### Hey!

I am Carlos, a Research Consultant at the [Public Management School of the Universidad del Pacífico](https://www.up.edu.pe/egp/){:target="_blank"} in Lima, Perú, and the Co-director of Evidencia [ZOE Institute for future-fit economies](https://zoe-institut.de/en/startpage/){:target="_blank"}. Next to my PhD, I'm also doing a Masters in Philosophy at [Fernuniversität Hagen](https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/KSW/portale/maphil/){:target="_blank"}.

As an ecological economist, my current [research](02_research.markdown) focuses on linking social and ecological perspectives, especially around questions on labor. In the past, I have [published](/03_publications.markdown) on feminist ecological economics, degrowth and philosophy of (plural) economics. In my free time, I play [foosball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Et2e1_NCzwA){:target="_blank"} semi-professionally, and I like to sing, roller skate, and run.

Feel free to get in touch via [email](mailto:birte@strunk-mg.de) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/BirteStrunk){:target="_blank"}!
