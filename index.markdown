### Hey!

I am Carlos E. Revoredo Mendieta, a Research Consultant at the Public Policy Observatory of the [Universidad del Pacífico](https://www.up.edu.pe/egp/){:target="_blank"} (Lima, Peru), and the Co-director of [Evidencia](https://evidencia-pe.com/blog/){:target="_blank"}. Prior to my current job position, I worked in a subnational government entity ([Gobierno Regional La Libertad](https://www.gob.pe/regionlalibertad){:target="_blank"}) as a Data Analyst, and did my internship at the Central Reserve Bank of Peru. I hold a BA in Economics from Universidad Privada del Norte (Trujillo, Peru). 

I have particular interest in the intersection between social development and public policies, making use of data and quantitative tools. My current [research](02_research.markdown) focuses on regional economies, labor and gender. Recently, I have collaborated preparing a [report](https://www.up.edu.pe/egp/observatorio/informe-ODS-Peru-observatorio-politicas-publicas-escuela-gestion-publica-universidad-pacifico/){:target="_blank"} that monitors the progress of the Sustainable Development Goals in Peru and it's 26 regions. I like tropicália music, geography and running.
